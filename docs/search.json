How are “seasons” defined in this plot? What do you think the “subseries” represent?\nThe plot shows a seasonal pattern in streamflow for the Cache la Poudre River. You can see that streamflow peaks in May-June, which can be classified as late spring and early summer. This is most likely due to snow melt as the weather gets warmer in these months. You can also see that streamflow is lowest in November-Febuary, which can be classified as late fall and winter.\n\n\n\nDecompose\n\nUse the model(STL(…)) pattern to decompose the time series data into its components: trend, seasonality, and residuals. Chose a window that you feel is most appropriate to this data…\n\npoudre_decomp &lt;- poudre_tbl |&gt;\n  model(STL(Flow ~ season(window = 13))) |&gt;\n  components()\n\nautoplot(poudre_decomp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe what you see in the plot. How do the components change over time? What do you think the trend and seasonal components represent?\nThe trend component increases from 2013-2015ish, then from 2016-2020 decreases, and after 2020 remains fairly stable. This trend component shows the fluctuation in streamflow over time, which could be reflective of changes in watershed hydrology. The seasonality component shows repeated peaks and valleys throughout the years. The peaks for this component are most likely during spring since there is likely be more snowmelt during that time (creating more streamflow). The remainder component varies a lot over the time period in the plot."
